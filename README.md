# DiVA
This repository contains an implementation of our proposed DiVA, a novel deep neural network based on audio-video modal fusion for efficient cognitive functions and analysis.

Note: Due to data privacy concerns, the code we released is not complete in some details, but the model structure part is the full version. We have hidden the parts about the data due to data privacy concerns.
